# What is Uniswap?
Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that aims to be an alternative to centralized exchanges.

On the lower lever, itâ€™s an algorithm that allows to make pools, or token pairs, and fill them with liquidity to let users exchange tokens using this liquidity. 
The algorithm is called an `automated market maker` or `automated liquidity provider`.

Market makers are entities that provide liquidity (trading assets) to markets. Liquidity is what makes trades possible.

A DEX must have enough (or a lot of) liquidity to function and serve as an alternative to centralized exchanges. The solution is to allow anyone to be a market maker, and this is what makes Uniswap an automated market maker. Any user can deposit their funds into a trading pair (and benefit from that).

## Constant Product Market Maker

Automated market maker is a general term that embraces different decentralized market maker algorithms.

At the core of Uniswap is the constant product function: `x * y = k`

Where x is the tokenA reserve, y is the tokenB reserve, and k is a constant value.
No matter how many tokens are traded for x or y, the constant of k must always remain the same.
